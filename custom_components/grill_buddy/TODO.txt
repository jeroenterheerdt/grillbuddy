	1. probes:
		source (sensor)
			validate check that the source exists (?)
			can this be a list of sensors instead of a textbox?
		preset or just temp
			whenever I change the preset on a probe, we create a new sensor. That should happen.

		notify when: (?)
			temp reached
			fallen below
			raised above
			outside of range
		deadzones
		what is the state of a probe? current temperature? whether it's on temperature vs target?
			right now went with current temperature
	2. presets:
		ability to define custom preset:
			name
			target temperature
	2a store temp as celsius internally but convert to fahrenheit as needed
	2b labels in options flow
	2c NL translations
	3. Notifications
		how to send?
		allow user to configure service to call for notifications.
			can I list the notify services?
2. Need to be able to set target temp for probes
		a. Protein selection
		b. Doneness
		c. + manual specify (custom config)
	3. Notifications when target temp is reached or has fallen below
		a. Deadzones
	4. Start timer after press a button
	5. Predict when its going to be on temp
    6. Logo/Icon
	7. native unit of measurement in sensor.py?
	8. services?
	9. implement time based things timers like stakemate?
